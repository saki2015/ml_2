Model was trained using nyc_fare_prediction_model-Copy.ipynb
This saved all of the following :
catpipe.sav
numpipe.sav
scaler.sav
nyc_stacked_model.sav

The first 3 are for the transformations;
in order to perform  transformations on the test data,
we load the *pipe.sav files;
then we load the trained model nyc_stacked_model.sav
and use it to predict the fare.

The following runs the Flask app in Docker, where the UI allows teh user to
enter the latitude/longitude/ date/time for the cab ride
and displays the predicted fare.

docker run -d -p 5007:5000 --name nyc nyc_flask
