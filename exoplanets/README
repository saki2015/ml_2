This was a highly imbalanced dataset.
The training data had an imbalance of 5050:37

So tried out the various sampling techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN;
also tried using the balancing related parameters for the various classifiers.
Despite trying out hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost using GridSearch, didn't get good recall scores
for the classifier.

The classifiers which gave good recall scores of 0.8 and close to 0.75 AUC were:
EasyEnsembleClassifier, BalancedRandomForesClassifier
