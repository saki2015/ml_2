House price prediction using model stacking
using the following as level0 estimators:
KNN, DecisionTree, SVR, RF, LGBM, XGB

and XGBRegressor as the level1 estimator.

Used scikit's StackingRegressor to create the stacked model.
Also tried Lasso standalone + ANN; but the stacked model gave the best results.
